In today's world, almost everyone has a mobile phone and receives communications (SMS/email) on a daily basis. However, the important fact is that the vast majority of messages received will be spam, with only a few being ham or vital communications. Scammers generate phoney text messages to trick you into disclosing personal information like your password, account number, or Social Security number. If they have this information, they may be able to access your email, bank, or other accounts.

In this post, we will use Tensorflow to create various deep learning models for SMS spam detection, as well as analyse their performance metrics.


We will use the SMS Spam Detection Dataset, which comprises SMS text and related labels (Ham or spam).
